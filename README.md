> Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way, when you criticize them, you’re a mile away and you have their shoes.

> If you tell the truth, you never have to remember anything.

> Some days you’re the bug; some days you’re the windshield.

> If you ever feel you are worthless remember that you are full of expensive organs.

> Mind is like a mad monkey.

> Let go, or be dragged.

> It’s always darkest before dawn. So if you’re going to steal your neighbor’s newspaper, that’s the time to do it.

> Don’t be irreplaceable. If you can’t be replaced, you can’t be promoted.

> Never test the depth of the water with both feet.

> If you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.

> Generally speaking, you aren’t learning much when your lips are moving.

> The Tao does not speak. The Tao does not blame. The Tao does not take sides. The Tao has no expectations. The Tao demands nothing of others. The Tao is not Jewish.
